# CSCI-5511
This contains the various assignments and my final project during the course period for the course CSCI 5511: Artificial Intelligence 1{University of Minnesota}.

The work contains various agents developed to play games like othello, connect five and also a league generation with specific constraints. Prolog was also used to code the logic in other assignments.

Some of the files have been referenced from various other contributors and authors and have been referenced in the respective files.

The project, connect 5 however is not fully functional as the alpha beta and minimax algorithms sometimes get stuck in an infinite loop.
